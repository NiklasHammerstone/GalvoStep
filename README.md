# GalvoStep
Project for building a cheap galvo laser system using Stepper motors and widely available parts.
The main goal is to engrave pictures onto wood much faster than a XY-machine could. 

This repo contains mechanical and electrical diagrams, firmware and extensive documentation of this project to maximize accessibility.
Feel free to copy/advance this project.

For a documentation of the supported G-code commands see the wiki.

### Final Update 20.03.2021

GalvoStep V1 is finished. See https://youtu.be/tV-LJvpVcUo for a typical engraving process. Accuracy is +-0.5mm I'd say. All the software can be found in CODES. 

### UPDATE 04.01.2021:
GalvoStep V1 is now functional but requires further testing. See https://youtu.be/xkFyk6ncNaY for initial test.
GUI (.py and .exe) and the Firmware for Teensy 4.0 can be found in CODES
