# GalvoStep
Project for building a cheap galvo laser system using Stepper motors and widely available parts.
The main goal is to engrave pictures onto wood much faster than a XY-machine could. 

This repo contains mechanical and electrical diagrams, firmware and extensive documentation of this project to maximize accessibility.
Feel free to copy/advance this project.

For a documentation of the supported G-code commands see the wiki.
